# So, you want to find the source.

...There's many ways!

## ◆ The Situation ◆

![No signature!](./md/res/nosig.png)

##### *Oh no! There's no signature to be seen anywhere and it's compressed to hell! Or wait, is there a way to find who made it? (hint: it's me!)*

You (or a friend) has found something extremely pleasing to look at, but in a tragic twist of events, it lacks any notable signatures or artist usernames! Luckily, over the years this has become such a problem that people have made many services for it and it's almost an entire topic!

So lets look at the options!


## ◆ Static Images ◆

These are the most common ones and have the most solutions to finding the source!

##### *Note: If it has a watermark that's a footer (ie iFunny, joyreactor), a reverse search will sometimes be much more effective if you crop it out.*

### ◆ Options ◆

#### ◆ 1 - SauceNao ◆

SauceNao primarily indexes booru style sites and some other common ones like DeviantArt and lightly, Pixiv. Under advanced options you can link to an image instead.

##### *Author's Note - Low Similarity Images may be NSFW. SauceNao can also do GIFs and similar out of the box, also integrates with other searches!* 

#### ◆ 2 - Reverse Image Search Engines ◆

##### *Here it actually comes up with only my retweets, not even the booru version that I used!*

SauceNao is optimised for art, but there's plenty that *aren't*. These generally have a broader scope, which means they may catch other rehosts too. Make sure to look out for common rehosters and to avoid them.

##### *Author's Note - Pinterest may come up often on searches. As of recent, Pinterest has allowed any user to click through to the original link of the image. Results may vary.*

#### ◆ 3 - Booru searches ◆

##### *This is e926 for those curious.*

If you are unlucky, the image may not come up in your common reverse search methods, in which you can use booru searches. Boorus such as Safebooru, e926 and their adult variants have exhaustive tag lists that can help you narrow down images quite far. 

Tags are commonly objective and use underscores instead of spaces. 

On e926, make sure to use tags that reflect the image and not the character as per their (controversial) [Tag What You See (TWYS) policy](https://e926.net/wiki_pages/e621:tag_what_you_see_(explained)) .

##### *Author's Note - Assume unknown boorus are NSFW until proven otherwise. Adblocker recommended. Boorus like DanBooru have tagging limits and viewing restrictions. I recommend using alternatives like GelBooru.*

## ◆ Animated Images, loops and videos ◆

These can get quite difficult, so lets get to the bulk of it.

#### ◆ Reverse searching the start frame ◆

Commonly, art sites will either cache a thumbnail (A selected frame of the image) or if that option isn't there, the first image of the video/gif. If you have an image that fades in/fades out, this might cause problems, however for those that don't, you'll usually be able to use the first frame to find the source.

You can either programmatically get the first frame by using a tool like FFMPEG to dump the frames, or you can scroll to the start of the animation. Make sure no overlays are present when you take an image of the footage.

##### *Author's Note - This is actually quite simple if you're familiar with the command line.*

### ◆ Other notes ◆

It's worth checking over multiple times for artist signatures. Sometimes artists may put them in animations elsewhere ie in the background, or it might be small. You can try multiple guess searches at a blurry signature, nobody will punish you for it!

Sometimes an artist has deleted their account (common amongst Japanese artists), in which case writing a name is still good courtesy!
